# code-execution-python

Use Heroku Dynos as a Python code execution environment within your AI applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) can use this Heroku app to boot [one-off dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos), install Python packages, and run Python code.

Best of all, the app is free to deploy and does not require actively running Dynos.
